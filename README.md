# Object-Detection
My personal project involved implementing an object detection system using artificial intelligence and deep learning technology. I utilized the YOLOv3 model, which is renowned for its accuracy and efficiency in object detection. The project encompassed loading the YOLOv3 weights and configuration, and I employed the OpenCV library to extract object class names from the coco.names.txt file.

I executed the object detection process on a targeted image after loading and preprocessing it. Leveraging the weights and configuration, I identified objects within the image, drew bounding boxes around them, and annotated them with classifications and probabilities.

Moreover, I extended the capabilities to include object detection in videos and even through a webcam, enabling real-time processing of streaming data.

This project not only deepened my understanding of deep learning and advancements in object detection but also provided a hands-on learning experience through practical application of artificial intelligence concepts."
